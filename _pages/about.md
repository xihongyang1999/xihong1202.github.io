<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D student at degree College of Computer Science and Technology, <a href="https://english.nudt.edu.cn/">National University of Defence Technology (NUDT)</a>. He is supervised by Prof. <a href="https://xinwangliu.github.io/">Xinwang Liu</a> and Prof. En Zhu in Pattern Recognition \& Machine Intelligence Lab (PRMI). 

My research interests include graph neural networks, recommender system, multi-view learning and LLM. I have published serveral papers at the top international AI conferences and journals, such AAAI, ICDE, NeurIPS, TNNLS...
